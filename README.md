## 📚 Learning Experience

Working on this project provided valuable insights and helped me enhance my programming skills in several key areas:

- **Deepened C Knowledge**: By working with C, I gained a deeper understanding of memory management, pointers, and low-level programming concepts.
- **Project Structuring**: I learned how to structure a software project from the ground up, organizing code into multiple source files and header files for better maintainability.
- **Graphics Rendering with MiniLibX**: This project gave me practical experience in using MiniLibX for simple graphics rendering and event handling.
